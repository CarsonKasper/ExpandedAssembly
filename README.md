This is my custom add-in for Fusion 360 that adds new tools tailored to the VEX CAD experience.

Unlinked Copy
– A copy-and-paste tool that creates a completely unlinked copy.

Flip Component
– Allows you to select a component and flip it over a plane, including its sketches.

Mirror Component
– A mix of Unlinked Copy and Flip Component. It first creates an unlinked copy and then flips the component.

THIS IS A NEW PROJECT NONE OF THESE TOOLS ARE COMPLETE YET, however the UI is set up.
